#JET CMS
Cloud Based CMS for App Engine

This is a story of a CMS that was needed for small businesses and big ideas. It started in 2012 as a small static serving website, but over time features were slowly added until the site was no longer static at all. 

Functionality to build pages and custom content types were added along with dynamically cropped images and stylesheets. Custom forms and user management are also planned. 

The purpose of this project is to allow anyone to have a solid and flexible platform that is cost efficient yet powerful. The language should be a pleasure to use and the API be easy to understand. 

So here and now we release this small beast of a project into the wild, hoping it will give you the publishing power you need to find success on the web. 


#Christmas Update 2016

It's been a while but the dream is still alive. Looking forward to adding some final pieces before a public beta release. If you need help getting it running or just understanding how it works, post your questions in the issue tracker.

Wanting to add these before release

+Form Maker
+Static Generator
+Separate Settings
+Cron Back Up Emailer
+Analytics Dashboard
+More Date tracking
+Garbage and Archive
+Version Control

So as you can see that's a lot of work, but I will keep posting any updates I have as soon as possible.

As always,

Live Long and Prosper
